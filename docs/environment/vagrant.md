# Environment Setup

## Vagrant

In order to get your vagrant box setup, do the following:

1. Setup and boot the vagrant box (this may take awhile):

  ```sh
  vagrant up
  ```

2. Login to the box via SSH:

  ```sh
  vagrant ssh
  ```

2. Navigate to the project mounted at `/vagrant`:

  ```sh
  cd /vagrant
  ```

NOTE: The base box can be found [here](https://github.com/gmcgibbon/just_chew_box).
